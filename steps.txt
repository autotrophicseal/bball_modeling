Steps:

Determine which features aren't helping with the NN model
Do the same with SVM
Remove the common features from the dataset. Document this somewhere

Determine potential combinations of features that you can add to the dataset.
For example multiplying certain features together or subtracting others

Run again and see how this affects the model

Determine what data we can add to the model
I think it may be useful to add number of given positions on a team
Perhaps multiply that with a couple of their stats (ie pointguard * height) might correlate to some of their defensive capbilities
Or we can add data about where they shoot from and multiply against the opposing team's defensive capabilities in that area


FAR AHEAD

Can we use RNN's or LSTM's to build a model that predicts a team's next game result?
Each team would go through a set of loops game by game through the season to predict the value.
Unsure if this is possible or any better...
