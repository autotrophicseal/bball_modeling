    "Of the many sports that I can bet on, I am going to bet only on NCAAB. I am going to start with MSU basketball, as this is a team I regularly follow and am able to watch in person and spend time analyzing it. If I find this is not enough to keep me occupied, I will look to Tennesse and Purdue to track as well. Purdue utilizes a vastly different approach to basketball than both Tennessee and MSU do which makes them an interesting one if I want to try something different. Quick recap:\n",

    "# Common Predictions in Basketball Betting\n",
    "\n",
    "In basketball betting, there are several common events or items that people try to predict. Let's explore some of these predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Game Outcome Predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predicting if Michigan State will win the game outright.\n",
    "- Predicting if Michigan State will cover the point spread (e.g., -14.5 points) or if the underdog (James Madison) will cover it.\n",
    "- Betting on the over/under total points scored in the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "*TOO VAGUE... SO MANY FACTORS CAN GO INTO THIS\n",
    "\n",
    "## Player Performance Predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predicting the total points scored by a specific Michigan State player in the game.\n",
    "- Predicting the total rebounds, assists, or steals by a particular player.\n",
    "- Betting on whether a player will achieve a double-double (e.g., points and rebounds) or a triple-double (points, rebounds, and assists).\n",
    "- Betting on which player will be the highest scorer in the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "*WITH MY CURRENT KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS COMPLETELY RANDOM... EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT INDIVIDUALS\n",
    "\n",
    "## Team Performance Predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predicting the total number of three-pointers made by Michigan State as a team.\n",
    "- Betting on which team will have the most rebounds or assists in the game.\n",
    "- Predicting if Michigan State will lead at halftime and win the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "*PROBABLY THE BETTER OF ALL THESE TO TRY AND PREDICT. RIGHT IN THE SWEET SPOT\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quarter/Half Predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predicting the winner of a specific quarter or half of the game.\n",
    "- Betting on the total points scored in a particular quarter or half.\n",
    "\n",
    "*THIS IS STUPID. VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prop Bets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- These are novelty bets that cover a wide range of events within the game. For example, you can bet on things like the first team to score, the first player to make a three-pointer, or the exact margin of victory.\n",
    "\n",
    "*STUPID AND NOVELTY SHIT. COMPLETELY RANDOM AND NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT\n",
    "\n",
    "## Live Betting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Betting on various in-game events as they happen, such as which team will score next or how many points will be scored in a specific time frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "*ABSOLUTELY NOT. AGAIN... COMPLETELY RANDOM\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parlays and Teasers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combining multiple bets into a single wager for a higher potential payout. For instance, you could bet on the game outcome, the total points, and a player's performance all in one bet.\n",
    "\n",
    "*SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAPPEN LATER IF I START TO UNDERSTAND BASIC TRENDS\n",
    "\n",
    "## Futures Betting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predicting events that will occur in the future, like which team will win the championship at the end of the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "*NO\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples of the many betting options available in sports betting. Keep in mind that the availability of specific bets and the odds associated with them can vary from sportsbook to sportsbook, and it's important to understand the odds and the game to make informed predictions and bets.\n"

    "As explained above, there are a lot of different options to choose from to focus in on. I am looking for something that focuses in on the gameplay of the game. I want to understand the relationships between the players on the field from both sides. I want to understand how previous games and previous stat's can help predict how individuals will do on the field. This will lead me to (hopefully) a better understanding of what makes a game swing one way vs the other. However, focusing too narrow will result in the inability to accuractely predict anything. It's virtually impossible to predict how a single individual will act. However, we can predict large groups of people with unbelievable certainty. As a result I will be focusing on the following.\n",
