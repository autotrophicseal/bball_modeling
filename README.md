# bball_modeling

This is a work in progress. The code is a mess. The repo is a mess. I'm just playing around with basketball related data and learning how to visualize and utilize it. Goal is to build a model that can predict various outcomes to basketball games. 

Biggest difficulty so far has been finding quality data that is free. Big breakthrough by utilizing the google cloud bigquery. Took that from Kaggle. Still need to cite it. But yeah ordinairily you would need to pay for that data. Somehow its free here...
